        <h2>Inspiration and Background</h2>
        <p>
          Stranger Danger was first conceptualized when looking at the problem sphere of student life. One particular issue that stood out was how often university students find themselves <strong>leaving school very late at night and felt unsafe commuting home,</strong> but was not able to do much about their schedules. We also found that they wished transit hired more security, and that they did not know what to do if caught in a dangerous situation/area.

          From this, we created Stranger Danger, putting our efforts into implementing <strong>a way for people to feel like they have help right at their fingertips, and a place to find advice from.</strong>

          <h2>Process</h2>
          <p>
            Our team's initial wireframing was clunky and difficult for users to see. We found that when we did user testing, people did not always intuitively understand what the icons could or could not do, and where to find the different sections. Thus, in our revised wireframing we worked to add hierarchy, clearer design and graphics, and simple choices for users to encounter. <br />

      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        This was the first mobile application I had ever created, and was definitely a fun project to make, despite its challenges. </p>
      <p>
        Usually as a visual designer, I find that I was not used to working on more back-end code. Working with databases was a challenge to me, but I overcame my lack of knowledge by watching multiple video tutorials, asking fellow classmates, and putting hours into reading online forums like Stack Overflow. </p>
      <p>
        I found that another challenge was being able to successfully code functionality while still maintaining a high standard visually for the user. I felt that it was very important to consider user experience in all aspects, and my team worked on iterating the project to stay simple but well-designed.

        <h2>Conclusions and Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          At the end of the project, our team was able to successfully meet the goals that we set for ourselves! Some of my proudest accomplishments in this project include our visual design, Working functionalities, and success among users. The front-facing design was focused on simplicity and easy navigation, and this came through as emphasized elements of our professional looking UI. As for our functionalities, I feel proud to be able to complete the functions of this application even though it was the first experience I had with Android Studios. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing not only the results of the app working, but also how fellow classmates loved the app! To our surprise, my partner and I found out that users really appreciated the idea and work we had done, and wanted us to publish the app on the app store for them to use. I am definitely pleased that not only were our goals met, but that the response for the app exceeded our expectations.
