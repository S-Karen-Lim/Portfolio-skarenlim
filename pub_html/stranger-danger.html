          This academic project was aimed to create a greater sense of safety and security for the daily transiting student. The app includes an alarm system, emergency GPS messaging, and an educational aid for basic first aid and self-defense.

      <h2>Contextual Research</h2>
      <p>
        Stranger Danger was first conceptualized when speaking to students about the problem areas of student life. One particular issue that stood out was how often university students find themselves <strong>commuting home late at night, but are not able to change their schedules.</strong> We also found that they wished transit hired more security, and that they did not know what to do if caught in a dangerous situation/area.<br />

        This initial reasearch led into our efforts to implement <strong>a way for users to feel more empowered in their safety.</strong>

      <h2>Application Solution: Stranger Danger</h2>
      <p>
        The application's main screen primarily holds an alarm system as a first response aid. The first button would play a loud alarm sound when pressed, much like a car alarm. <strong>We felt that this would draw attention towards a user</strong>, and possibly ward away people who may be intimidating <strong>without the use of force.</strong><br />
        The main screen's sceondary button is an emergency message trigger. This button allows a user to send three preset contacts a text that indicates where they are and that they need aid. <br />

        The last part is the Safety Tips, which include quick information on self-defense and first-aid. We hoped that we could provide <strong>not only a tool for use in specific situations, but also a place for preventative education.</strong>

          Our initial design started with wireframing on Adobe Illustrator. Part of <strong>my role in this inital phase involved ideation and ux design</strong> as well as some shared visual work with John. <br />
          Our team's initial wireframing was <strong>clunky and difficult for users to see.</strong> We found that when we did user testing, people did not always intuitively understand what the icons could or could not do, and where to find the different sections.

          In our revised implementation we added hierarchy by implementing clearer visuals, seen here as two obviously large buttons instead of four small ones. <strong>Compared to our older layout, this creates simple choices for users to encounter.</strong> This became an integral part of our descision decisions as in an emergency or high-alert situation, our users would need to be able to act quickly.

      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        This was the first mobile application I had ever created, and was definitely a fun project to make, despite its challenges. </p>
      <p>
        Usually as a visual designer, I found that I was not used to working on more back-end code. Working with databases was a challenge to me, but <strong>I worked hard on decreasing my lack of knowledge</strong> by watching multiple video tutorials, asking fellow classmates, and putting time and effort into reading online forums like Stack Overflow. </p>
      <p>
        I found that another challenge was <strong>being able to successfully code functionality while still maintaining a high visual standard</strong> for the user. I felt that it was very important to consider user experience in all aspects, and my team worked on iterating the project to stay simple but well-designed.

      <h2>Conclusions and Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        At the end of the project, our team was able to successfully meet the goals that we set for ourselves! Some of my proudest accomplishments in this project include our visual design, Working functionalities, and success among users. <br />

        The front-facing design was focused on simplicity and easy navigation, and this came through as emphasized elements of our professional looking UI. As for our functionalities, I feel proud to be able to complete the functions of this application even though it was the first experience I had with Android Studios. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing not only the results of the app working, but also how fellow classmates loved the app! To our surprise, my partner and I found out that users really appreciated the idea and work we had done, and wanted us to publish the app on the app store for them to use. I am definitely pleased that not only were our goals met, but that the response for the app exceeded our expectations.
