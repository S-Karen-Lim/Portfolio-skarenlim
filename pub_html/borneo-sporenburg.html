          <strong>Brief:</strong> Conceptual architectural form project
        </p>

          This concept architecture project was done in a team of six, where we were tasked to come up with a form that was site and cultural appropriate, program specific, and visually appealing. I was the main visual artist in this project and did most of the diagram and sketch work. Throughout the four-week process, our team had moved through several ideas but finalized on the core statement of our building being: "A well of light piercing pods of life". <br />

          Situated in Borneo Sporenburg, Amsterdam, we created a long and narrow canal house that was directed to be temporary homes for the 'urban nomad', a busy travelling city worker, whom were only looking for a temporary room to rent but desired the comfort of community and the urban landscape. We finished the project with a final physical model and a CAD software designed form to be presented to an audience of professors, mentors, and fellow classmates.

        <h2>Sketching and Process Work</h2>
        <p>
          A large part of the process was creating a coherent form that fit within the site and for the target user. Through much iteration, we evolved a messy and random shape into a clean-cut and detailed building that was minimal, spacious, and respected the nature of the location and the user.</strong>

          <h2>Researching Culture and Realizing Meaningful Details</h2>
          <p>
            This project was one that did not only improve my design knowledge and understanding, but also allowed me to discover my passion for creating a meaningful product for others. I learned that good design does not come from only one's level of skill, but more so presently from being able to create value for others and oneself. This project taught me more about people and how they moved, gathered, and lived, allowing me to grow culturally and socially in various aspects.

      <h2>Challenges: Learning a new way to work</h2>
      <p>
        A real challenge in this project was figuring out how to reflect the concepts that students and architects have been developing over countless decades into our form. Being able to think of the user experience further than the surface 'user enjoyment' and delving deeper into thinking about considerations such as impact of presence of the form on the user, the sound of the material under a user's feet, and distances creating conversation were all hugely fundamental to the form of the building. Discovering what really defined 'enjoyment' in our form is where I believe was a struggle but was overcome brilliantly.</p>
        <p>
        On a personal level, in this team project my own challenge was discovering what areas I could be a strong team member. I think most students often struggle when someone else cannot give them necessary directions when there are other group members with the same skills. In learning how to interact with my other teammates in order to understand what roles they could work in as well as how I could make myself essential to each person was a new experience I felt was interesting. Now, I continue to develop these kinds of self-sufficient skills, and possibly also create a higher level of confidence in believing that I can make a positive difference for the teams that I work with and the community the project designs toward.

        <h2>Conclusions and Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          At the end of the project, our team was able to successfully meet the goals that we set for ourselves! Some of my proudest accomplishments in this project include our visual design, Working functionalities, and success among users. The front-facing design was focused on simplicity and easy navigation, and this came through as emphasized elements of our professional looking UI. As for our functionalities, I feel proud to be able to complete the functions of this application even though it was the first experience I had with Android Studios. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing not only the results of the app working, but also how fellow classmates loved the app! To our surprise, my partner and I found out that users really appreciated the idea and work we had done, and wanted us to publish the app on the app store for them to use. I am definitely pleased that not only were our goals met, but that the response for the app exceeded our expectations.
