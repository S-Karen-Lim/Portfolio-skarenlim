      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My full name is Shenghui Karen Lim, and along with my Chinese-Canadian birth, I have always had a curious mix of cultures growing up in and around home. Having these influences has allowed me to really appreciate <strong>going beyond stereotypes and standards,</strong> and <strong>being open to the differences</strong> people have is important to me. I put my best efforts into the things I know and also don't know (yet!), and I am someone who constantly craves improving myself in all areas of <strong>user experience design, visual design, and technical skill.</strong> I am passionate about creating real meaning and value for users through the the things I create, and I hope to be able to inspire others to do the same.
